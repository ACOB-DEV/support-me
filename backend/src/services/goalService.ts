/**
 * Shared goal logic used by the donation-recording routes
 * (routes/donations.ts, services/subscriptionExecutor.ts) and by the
 * recurring-reset scheduler (services/goalResetScheduler.ts).
 *
 * Multi-asset design decision (issue #18): goal amounts are tracked
 * per-asset, never normalized to USD. This is a testnet demo app with no
 * price oracle, and the existing single-goal model already assumed one
 * amount unit — adding real USD normalization here would require
 * integrating an external price feed, which is out of scope for this
 * change. A goal is denominated in exactly one `currency` (its `currency`
 * field); a donation only ever contributes to goals whose currency matches
 * the donation's own `currency`/asset code. Multi-asset totals (e.g. a
 * creator's overall "goals" view) are therefore a per-asset breakdown, not a
 * single blended number — see routes/creators.ts's goals list, which
 * returns each goal with its own currency rather than summing across them.
 */

/**
 * Donation-to-goal split rule (issue #20 acceptance criteria: "Donations
 * update the correct goal's progress"):
 *
 * A donation is applied IN FULL to every one of the creator's ACTIVE goals
 * denominated in the same currency as the donation — not divided/split
 * across them. Rationale: each goal is an independent target (e.g. "New
 * microphone — 500 XLM" and "Monthly support — 2000 XLM"); a supporter's tip
 * is genuine progress toward both at once, the same way it would be if the
 * creator tracked each goal by hand. Splitting the amount evenly across N
 * goals would mean adding a second goal silently halves the progress rate on
 * the first, which is surprising to the creator and actively punishes having
 * multiple goals. Applying the full amount to every matching active goal
 * keeps each goal's meaning ("progress toward this specific target")
 * independent of how many other goals happen to exist alongside it.
 *
 * Returns the goals this donation carried to their target, so the caller can
 * send goal-reached notifications once its transaction has committed.

 * result back — two concurrent donations would both start from the same
 * stale `currentAmount` and the second write would silently erase the first

 * the current row value, inside a guarded conditional update so that of any
 * number of concurrent donations, exactly one "claims" the below-target →
 * at-or-above-target crossing (Postgres re-evaluates the WHERE clause after
 * the row lock is released, so a loser of the race sees the winner's new
