# Backend Configuration

This reference covers every environment setting read by `backend/src` and the
settings currently shown in [`../.env.example`](../.env.example). Set values in
the environment used by the backend process; restarting the process is required
after a change.

## Core runtime and database

| Variable | Required? | Default / behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Required for a working backend; production startup validates it. | None in code. `.env.example` shows a local PostgreSQL URL; use the URL for the environment's database. |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Required outside tests. | None. The server refuses to start without it; generate a private value, for example with `openssl rand -hex 32`. Tests generate an ephemeral process-local secret if unset. |
| `NODE_ENV` | Optional. Set explicitly in deployed environments. | Unset is treated as non-production by environment checks; `production` enables strict startup validation, and `test` enables test-only behavior. |
| `PORT` | Optional. | `4000`. |

## Browser access and proxy

| Variable | Required? | Default / behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | Optional; set for deployed browser frontends. | Empty. Comma-separated exact origins. Outside production, `https://localhost:3000`, `https://127.0.0.1:3000`, `http://localhost:3000` and `http://127.0.0.1:3000` are added automatically (the frontend's `npm run dev` serves HTTPS; `npm run dev:http` and Playwright use HTTP). Production allows no browser origins unless configured. |
| `TRUST_PROXY` | Optional; set when the API is behind a trusted reverse proxy. | Unset leaves Express's default. Set to the number of proxy hops (commonly `1` on Railway) so IP-based limits see the client address. |

## Public API rate limits

All values must be positive integers. Window values are milliseconds. Limits
are held in memory and apply per backend process; set `TRUST_PROXY` correctly so
per-IP limits use the caller's address behind a trusted proxy.

| Variable | Default | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AUTH_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS` | `60000` | Window for wallet challenge and verification limits. |
| `AUTH_RATE_LIMIT_IP_MAX` | `30` | Requests per IP, independently for each wallet-auth endpoint. |
| `AUTH_CHALLENGE_RATE_LIMIT_ACCOUNT_MAX` | `5` | Challenge requests per wallet. |
| `AUTH_VERIFY_RATE_LIMIT_ACCOUNT_MAX` | `10` | Verification attempts per wallet. |
| `DONATION_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS` | `60000` | Window for donation-creation limits. |
| `DONATION_RATE_LIMIT_IP_MAX` | `60` | Donation-creation requests per IP. |
| `DONATION_RATE_LIMIT_ACCOUNT_MAX` | `20` | Donation-creation requests per sender wallet. |
| `MAGIC_LINK_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS` | `900000` | Window for magic-link request limits. |
| `MAGIC_LINK_RATE_LIMIT_IP_MAX` | `30` | Magic-link requests per IP. |
| `MAGIC_LINK_RATE_LIMIT_ACCOUNT_MAX` | `5` | Magic-link requests per normalized email address. |

## Soroban event listener and RPC

| Variable | Required? | Default / behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `STELLAR_NETWORK` | Optional; set explicitly outside testnet. | `testnet` (also accepts `mainnet`/`public`, `futurenet`). Selects the network passphrase used by the executor and boot validation. `NEXT_PUBLIC_STELLAR_NETWORK` is accepted as a fallback so frontend and backend share one value. At boot the server calls `getNetwork` on every RPC endpoint and refuses to start (production) if a passphrase disagrees, a configured contract is missing, or `EXECUTOR_SECRET_KEY` is unparseable (#281). |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_DONATION_CONTRACT_ID` | Required for a normal backend startup and required by production configuration validation. | None. The event listener skips polling without it, and the subscription executor cannot start without it. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CREATOR_REGISTRY_CONTRACT_ID` | Optional. | Unset; the listener watches the donation contract only. Set the registry address to include it in listener monitoring; it is also verified at boot. |
| `SOROBAN_RPC_URLS` | Optional; preferred for the RPC client pool. | If unset, endpoint selection falls through to `SOROBAN_RPC_ENDPOINTS`, then `SOROBAN_RPC_URL`, then the public testnet endpoint. Accepts a comma-separated priority list. |
| `SOROBAN_RPC_ENDPOINTS` | Optional compatibility alias. | Used only when `SOROBAN_RPC_URLS` is unset; comma-separated priority list. |
| `SOROBAN_RPC_URL` | Optional legacy/single endpoint. | `https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org`. It is the final fallback for the shared RPC client and is also read directly by the event listener. |
| `SOROBAN_RPC_TIMEOUT_MS` | Optional. | `10000` ms per endpoint when unset, invalid, or non-positive. |
| `SOROBAN_EVENTS_POLL_INTERVAL_MS` | Optional. | `5000` ms. |
| `SOROBAN_EVENTS_LOOKBACK_LEDGERS` | Optional. | `100` ledgers on the listener's initial scan. |
| `SOROBAN_USDC_ISSUER` | Not currently consumed by backend code. | No effect. This legacy example entry is retained here to make clear that setting it does not configure token classification. |
| `SOROBAN_USDC_TOKEN_ID` | Not currently consumed by backend code. | No effect. This legacy example entry is retained here to make clear that setting it does not configure token classification. |

The shared RPC pool supports failover for callers using `sorobanRpc`. The event
listener currently uses `SOROBAN_RPC_URL` directly, so configure that variable
as well if the listener needs a non-default endpoint.

## Recurring donations and scheduled work

| Variable | Required? | Default / behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `EXECUTOR_SECRET_KEY` | Required for normal backend startup because the subscription executor is started with the server. | None. This operational Stellar key must be registered as the donation contract executor and funded for transaction fees. Do not reuse a user wallet or commit the secret. On testnet/futurenet a missing account is auto-funded via Friendbot at startup (#279). |
| `SUBSCRIPTION_EXECUTOR_POLL_INTERVAL_MS` | Optional. | `60000` ms. |
| `SUBSCRIPTION_EXECUTOR_EXPECTED_INTERVAL_MS` | Optional. | Three times the polling interval, or `180000` ms with the default poll interval. Used by executor health reporting. |
| `FRIENDBOT_URL` | Optional. | `https://friendbot.stellar.org`. Endpoint used to auto-fund a missing executor account on testnet/futurenet; never called on mainnet. |
| `EXECUTOR_LOW_BALANCE_XLM` | Optional. | `0.5`. XLM balance below which `/health/executor` reports `lowBalance: true`. |
| `GOAL_RESET_CHECK_INTERVAL_MS` | Optional. | `3600000` ms (one hour). |

## Admin access

| Variable | Required? | Default / behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ADMIN_WALLETS` | Optional; required to grant admin access. | Empty allowlist. Comma-separated Stellar wallet addresses. |

## Sign-in providers

| Variable | Required? | Default / behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `TWITTER_CLIENT_ID` | Optional. | Unset. Twitter/X OAuth is unavailable unless all three Twitter variables are configured. |
| `TWITTER_CLIENT_SECRET` | Optional. | Unset. |
| `TWITTER_REDIRECT_URI` | Optional. | Unset; set to the exact callback URL registered with the provider (locally `https://localhost:3000/auth/twitter/callback`). |

## Email and application links

| Variable | Required? | Default / behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | Optional. | Unset; outbound messages are logged instead of sent. |
| `EMAIL_FROM` | Optional. | `SupportMe <notifications@supportme.app>`. Use a sender verified with Resend in deployed environments. |
| `APP_URL` | Optional locally; set to the canonical public frontend URL in staging and production. | Context-dependent: some email/SEO paths fall back to `https://supportme.app`, while magic-link, notification and preview paths fall back to `https://localhost:3000` (the frontend's local HTTPS dev origin). Set it explicitly outside local development so generated links point to the right environment. |
| `RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Optional for the app; required to accept Resend webhook requests. | Unset; webhook requests are rejected when no signing secret is configured. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_STELLAR_NETWORK` | Optional. | `TESTNET`; used to select the network label/link in email templates and as a fallback for the backend's `STELLAR_NETWORK`. |

## Observability

| Variable | Required? | Default / behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SENTRY_DSN` | Optional. | Unset disables backend Sentry initialization. |

## Environment checklist

- **Local development:** set `DATABASE_URL`, `JWT_SECRET`,
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_DONATION_CONTRACT_ID`, and `EXECUTOR_SECRET_KEY` for the normal
  server startup path. The example database URL and public testnet RPC are for
  local/testnet use only.
- **Staging:** use staging database and secret values, set the exact staging
  frontend origin in `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`, set `APP_URL`, and point the
  contract IDs and RPC endpoint pool at the intended Stellar network.
- **Production:** set all four core startup values above, use a unique strong
  `JWT_SECRET`, configure `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`, `APP_URL`, and `TRUST_PROXY`
  for the deployed topology, and provide verified email/Sentry settings if
  those services are enabled. Store secrets in the hosting provider's secret
  environment, not in the repository.

The root [README](../../README.md) contains the contract address table and
production promotion context. See also the
[contract deploy and promotion workflow](../../docs/contract-deploy-workflow.md).
