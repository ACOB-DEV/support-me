#![no_std]

//! Shared data types for the SupportMe contracts. Kept in their own crate so
//! that `donation` and `creator-registry` agree on a single, canonical
//! definition and can exchange values across contract calls.
//!
//! # Instance TTL
//!
//! Both contracts keep their critical configuration (admin set, threshold,
//! timelock, registry / donation contract address, executor, pause flag and
//! token allowlist) in instance storage. Instance storage shares a single TTL
//! with the contract instance, and extending it also extends the contract's
//! Wasm code entry. If that TTL lapses during a quiet period the contract is
//! archived and every call fails until someone submits a restore operation.
//!
//! To prevent that, every state-changing entry point calls
//! [`extend_instance_ttl`], and each contract exposes a permissionless
//! `bump()` that an off-chain scheduler (e.g. the backend executor) can call
//! during long idle periods:
//!
//! - [`INSTANCE_BUMP_AMOUNT`]: the TTL (in ledgers) the instance is extended
//!   to, ~30 days at 5s/ledger.
//! - [`INSTANCE_LIFETIME_THRESHOLD`]: the extension is only written once the
//!   remaining TTL falls below this (~29 days), so normal usage does not pay
//!   for a rent bump on every call.
