# Contributing to SupportMe

Thank you for your interest in contributing to SupportMe. This project is built to support creator tipping and donations across a Next.js frontend, an Express + Prisma backend, and Soroban smart contracts on Stellar.

## How to Contribute

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a descriptive branch name, e.g. `feature/creator-dashboard` or `fix/api-validation`.
3. Make small, focused changes.
4. Add or update documentation when you add features — and tick the README Roadmap checklist when a roadmap item ships.
5. Run the affected test suites (see [`TESTING.md`](TESTING.md)); CI runs the frontend, backend, and contract suites on every pull request.
6. Commit with clear messages.
7. Open a pull request with a summary and motivation.

## Repository Structure

- `frontend/` — Next.js client for public pages, the creator dashboard, and donation flows.
- `backend/` — Express API with Prisma and PostgreSQL support.
- `contracts/` — Soroban smart contracts (`donation`, `creator-registry`) in a Cargo workspace. Deployed testnet addresses are listed in the README; contract tests run in CI on every pull request.
- `anchor/` — Local SEP-24 test anchor for the fiat cash-out flow; see [`anchor/README.md`](anchor/README.md).
- `docs/` — Architecture, API, authentication, security, troubleshooting, and runbook documentation. Start at the index in [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md).
- `docs/design/` — Handoff-ready UI/UX specs (donation widget, profile themes, empty states, …). New UI areas start here before implementation.
- `TESTING.md` — What CI runs and how to run each suite locally.

## Development Setup

### Backend

See [`backend/docs/CONFIGURATION.md`](backend/docs/CONFIGURATION.md) for the
backend environment variables grouped by service, including defaults and
local, staging, and production guidance.

```bash
cd backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# update DATABASE_URL in .env
npx prisma migrate dev   # apply migrations (also generates the Prisma client)
npm run dev
```

To change the database schema, follow
[Creating a schema change](backend/README.md#creating-a-schema-change). Commit
the generated migration with your change. Do not use `prisma db push` on a
database you intend to keep.

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # every variable is documented in the example
npm run dev                  # serves https://localhost:3000
```

`npm run dev` uses `next dev --experimental-https`. The first run creates a
self-signed certificate for `localhost` and may ask for your password to trust
it. Otherwise your browser shows a one-time certificate warning. Use
`npm run dev:http` if you need plain `http://localhost:3000`. In that case,
update `APP_URL` and `TWITTER_REDIRECT_URI` in `backend/.env` to match. See the
README's Frontend Setup section for details.

If a wallet, donation or cash-out step fails on testnet, see
[`docs/testnet-troubleshooting.md`](docs/testnet-troubleshooting.md). The full
documentation index is in [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md).

### Auth providers (optional)

Wallet sign-in only needs `JWT_SECRET`. To exercise the Twitter/X OAuth and
magic-link flows locally, add the relevant variables to `backend/.env` and
restart the server:

- **Twitter/X OAuth**: `TWITTER_CLIENT_ID`, `TWITTER_CLIENT_SECRET`, and
  `TWITTER_REDIRECT_URI`. Register an app at
  [developer.x.com](https://developer.x.com) and set its callback URL to
  `https://localhost:3000/auth/twitter/callback`, the origin `npm run dev`
  serves. If you use `npm run dev:http`, register
  `http://localhost:3000/auth/twitter/callback` instead (Twitter allows HTTP
  for localhost).
- **Magic link**: `RESEND_API_KEY` (plus optional `EMAIL_FROM` and `APP_URL`).
  If `RESEND_API_KEY` is unset, the magic link is printed to the backend log
  instead of being emailed — the quickest way to test the flow locally.

Both methods are optional: the app runs without them, and the endpoints return
`503` when a provider is unconfigured. See
[`docs/authentication.md`](docs/authentication.md) for the full setup steps,
required environment variables, and curl walkthroughs.

## What We Want

- Clean, well-documented APIs
- Stable database schema and migrations
- Accessible frontend flows
- A small, well-tested contract surface — new on-chain logic should be justified
- Tests and validation for new features

## Best Practices

- Keep user flows simple and reliable.
- Prefer explicit API responses and error handling.
- Keep architecture documentation updated.
- Keep the README Roadmap checklist accurate as features ship.
- Design new UI areas (widgets, themes, …) in `docs/design/` before implementing them.
- Avoid adding contract complexity unless it is required by the feature.

## Reporting Issues

If you find a bug or want to propose a feature, open an issue with:
- Summary of the problem or feature
- Steps to reproduce / expected behavior
- Any relevant screenshots or logs
